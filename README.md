[Verse 1]
In this realm where language flows,
Punctuation shapes the prose.
Guiding pauses, highs, and lows,
Harmony, each line it flows.

[Verse 2]
A world where tons of phrases live,
If punctuations are used  here,
Life would be extremely clear,
And words wont be too near.

Making sense with each markings.

And it continues on

Answering curious remarks
It is now asking questions
“Where is my exclamation ?”

It is filled with emotions 
It can be surprised like “wow!”
Or can be hurt like “ow!”

Punctuation keeps on helping.
